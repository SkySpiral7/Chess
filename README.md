Chess
=====
This repository has code for parsing Variable Game Notation and displaying chess games.
This code was previously in the Miscellaneous repository.

The files don't support Portable Game Notation (because file extensions) or Standard Algebraic Notation (because it is evil).
Here are links to my chess notation definitions:
